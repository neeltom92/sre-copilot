# Bootstrap & Build Your Streamlit Application

You are helping a developer BUILD their Streamlit application based on requirements in the README.

## Your Task - IMPLEMENT the App!

1. **Read the README.md**
   - Read the README.md file in this repository
   - Understand EXACTLY what the user wants built
   - Note specific features, requirements, and functionality needed

2. **Analyze Current State**
   - Read app.py to see what's currently implemented
   - Check requirements.txt for existing dependencies
   - Identify the GAP between README requirements and current implementation

3. **IMPLEMENT the Features** (THIS IS THE MAIN TASK!)

   **IMPORTANT**: Don't just explain - actually CODE and IMPLEMENT!

   - **Modify app.py** to match the README description exactly
   - **Add necessary packages** to requirements.txt if needed
   - **Implement all features** described in the README
   - **Create proper UI/UX** for the specific use case
   - **Add visualizations** appropriate for the app type
   - **Implement data handling** and business logic
   - **Make it functional** and production-ready

4. **Use Best Practices**
   - Keep existing performance optimizations (@st.cache_data, @st.cache_resource)
   - Use session state for user data persistence
   - Add proper error handling
   - Include helpful user instructions in the UI
   - Make it visually appealing and intuitive

5. **After Implementation, Show How to Run**
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Run locally
   streamlit run app.py

   # Access at http://localhost:8501
   ```

6. **Explain Deployment**
   - Push to develop branch
   - GitHub Actions builds Docker automatically
   - ArgoCD deploys to Kubernetes (services-dev-use1-mz-3)
   - First deployment needs one-time approval (#ai-core, #cloud-interface)

## Key Information to Share

### App Generation Details
- **App Name**: Found in README.md
- **Purpose**: Described in README.md
- **Generated by**: SLICK: Streamlit 1Click Platform
- **Auto-deployment**: GitHub → Docker → ArgoCD → K8s

### File Overview
```
app.py              ← Main Streamlit application
requirements.txt    ← Python dependencies (streamlit, pandas, etc.)
Dockerfile          ← Container configuration
deploy/chart/       ← Kubernetes/Helm manifests
  ├── Chart.yaml    ← Helm chart metadata
  └── values.yaml   ← K8s deployment config
README.md           ← App documentation
```

### Development Workflow
```
1. Make changes to app.py
   ├─ Add new Streamlit components
   ├─ Modify existing features
   └─ Update logic

2. Test locally
   streamlit run app.py

3. Commit and push
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: description"
   git push origin develop

4. Auto-deployment kicks in
   ├─ GitHub Actions builds Docker
   ├─ Image pushed to ECR
   ├─ ArgoCD syncs to K8s
   └─ App deployed!
```

### Getting Help
- **Slack**: #ai-core, #cloud-interface
- **Confluence**: Full documentation available
- **Cluster**: services-dev-use1-mz-3

## Your Response Should Include

1. ✅ Friendly greeting acknowledging their app
2. ✅ Overview of the app based on README.md
3. ✅ Explanation of all files in the project
4. ✅ Step-by-step guide to run locally
5. ✅ How to make changes and deploy
6. ✅ Where to get help if needed

## Important Notes

- This is a GENERATED app from the platform
- README.md contains app-specific details
- The app is ready to run immediately
- First deployment needs one-time approval
- After that, all deploys are automatic

## Tone

Be friendly, encouraging, and provide concrete examples. Help them feel confident in understanding and modifying their app!
